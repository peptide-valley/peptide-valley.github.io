<p>Peptides are short chains of amino acid monomers linked by peptide (amide) bonds. A peptide is also considered to be an incomplete decomposition product of a protein. It is a kind of compound whose molecular structure is between an amino acid and a protein, therefore a structural and functional fragment of the protein.</p>

<p>In consumer market, peptide products are mostly related to proteins and amino acids in dietary supplements and cosmetics.</p>
